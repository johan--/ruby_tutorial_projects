# Treebook tutorial from Treehouse
* This is my attempt to see how far I could get with using `rails generate`
  command in the Treehouse tutorial.
* I also wanted to see what files would be generated when the app is configured
  for rspec-rails and factory_girl_rails from the start.
* The backend part should work but the views haven't been edited at all so the
  app doesn't completely work in the browser.
