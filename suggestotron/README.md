## Further Exercises

* Sort topics by their number of votes
* Add an 'about' page, linked from the bottom of the Suggestotron topics list. Link back to the Topics list from the About page so users don't get stranded.
* Users should be allowed to vote only once: give votes a user_id and allow a user
to have voted on each topic only once. Devise ?
* Users should be able to give a post a 'negative' vote instead of a positive one.
How might you represent that in this system?
